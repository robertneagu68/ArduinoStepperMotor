# ArduinoStepperMotor

This code was used to program an Arduino UNO microcontroller which gives instructions to a stepper motor on how it should spin when a button, connected to a breadboard, is pressed.

The first push of the button gives the motor a command to spin 1400 steps in a direction.
The second push of the button switches the spinning direction, while the amount of steps remain the same.
